        Hey gABE,<br>

So, I’ve written a lot of my own words for you. However, for today, I’d like to share one of my favourite poems with you. I remember 
reading this when I was younger after my brother had shown it to me. I always thought “Wow, imagine having someone I could relate this 
to”. I KNOW it’s corny but I’d love to share this poem with you :)</p>

<p><b>Morning by Frank O'Hara</b></p>

<p class="thin-font-3">I've got to tell you<br>
how I love you always<br>
I think of it on grey<br>
mornings with death<br><br>

in my mouth the tea<br>
is never hot enough<br>
then and the cigarette<br>
dry the maroon robe
<br><br>
chills me I need you<br>
and look out the window<br>
at the noiseless snow
<br><br>
At night on the dock<br>
the buses glow like<br>
clouds and I am lonely<br>
thinking of flutes
<br><br>
I miss you always<br>
when I go to the beach<br>
the sand is wet with<br>
tears that seem mine
<br><br>
although I never weep<br>
and hold you in my<br>
heart with a very real<br>
humor you'd be proud of
<br><br>
the parking lot is<br>
crowded and I stand<br>
rattling my keys the car<br>
is empty as a bicycle
<br><br>
what are you doing now<br>
where did you eat your<br>
lunch and were there<br>
lots of anchovies it
<br><br>
is difficult to think<br>
of you without me in<br>
the sentence you depress<br>
me when you are alone
<br><br>
Last night the stars<br>
were numerous and today<br>
snow is their calling<br>
card I'll not be cordial
<br><br>
there is nothing that<br>
distracts me music is<br>
only a crossword puzzle<br>
do you know how it is<br><br>

when you are the only<br>
passenger if there is a<br>
place further from me<br>
I beg you do not go<br><br><br>
