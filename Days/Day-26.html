        Hi Gabe!<br>

So… you’re currently in the Gold Coast :( I am not there most likely but if I am omg. If not, I am so sad ooh my gosh.<br>

I’d just like to have a stern chat with you so you don’t forget who I am <br>

I really love and appreciate everything you do for me. Genuinely, I don’t know where I would be right now without you. I know we go through things sometimes, but I really appreciate how we’re able to communicate with each other. Everyday I’m learning more about you and growing along with you. It’s fun, hard and confusing but I would be in no other place. I love spending my time with you and honestly just having you in my presence. 
<br>
I’m really happy about the place we’re in and I can’t wait to grow and learn about life with you :) 
<br><br>
Yours Truly,<br>
Vivian :^|
