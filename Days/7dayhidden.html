        Hi Gabe!<br>
        Hope that you’re doing well. It’s Wednesday if I’m not mistaken (if I was that would be embarrassing) BUT YES ~ I hope that you’re doing well. I’ve been thinking a lot about some funny moments we’ve shared and I’d like to make a top 10 list of when I’ve laughed the hardest…</p>
    <p class="thin-font-3"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>1.</p>
    <p class="thin-font-3">Everytime :p</p>
    <p class="thin-font-3">HAHAHa do you like my humor…<br>
        You better >:(<br>
        Anyways I really could not name every single time or list it in a watch mojo top 10 list but there was this very memorable time:<br><br>
        We were sitting on the bed and you were trying not to make me laugh. You were like “Vivian… I’m dying” and I would just burst into laughter :/ I felt like smiling every time I looked at you BUT then you would start speaking and I wouldn’t even concentrate on what you were saying, I was just really happy to be right there, laughing at (with) you 🙂<br>
        Enjoy your day today, make sure you be super nice to me or whatever I don’t care it’s cool<br><br>
        - Vivian *_*</p>
